Django Notes:
    - if you're using the tutorial, replace all "python" CLI coms with "python3"
    - whenever a change is made to the model, run "python3 manage.py makemigrations recsapp"
    - running the server will 404 - add recsapp to the end to view index
        - add admin to the end to view admin page, use super user login
Super user:
    - user: superuser
    - pw: oasisproj
