# Movie Recommendations

This project, developed by Will Redding, Risha Ranjan, and Dominic Imondi, was made during Northeastern's Oasis Club's spring semester. Built in Python with Django, this site allows users to enter information on their movie preferences, returning a series of movies that fit those preferences from those in the IMDb top 250 movies of all time. This process converts the user's prefences into vectors, filters poorly fitting movie out, and compares the remaining movies using vector similarity. 

To run this project, you can clone the repo to your machine. As long as you have python setup (python3 and and django), you can simply run `python3 manage.py runserver`, and the site will run locally.
